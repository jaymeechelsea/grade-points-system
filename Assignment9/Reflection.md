**Reflection**

While I was trying to design the domain model and the class diagram for the Grade Points’ System they were both quite difficult to put together. One of the big difficulties was in figuring out and deciding which details were necessary for the core functionality and which I could leave out. An example of this would be while I was tempted to over explain how the notifications would be sent either via email, SMS or push notifications, I realised I needed to make this into a general Notification entity to keep everything clear and to ensure there is flexibility. Another challenge came up while I was trying to figure out the relationships for each entity like association, aggregation, and composition. I spent a lot of time trying to decide if the entities like Point should be tightly bound to Grade or kept as independent constructs. I ended up choosing association to ensure it could be reused and for better scalability. Figuring out the right responsibilities and methods for each class was also quite difficult. It was quite easy to give too much to entities like Admin or User with unnecessary logic, but I tried to aim to link them by assigning more focused responsibilities. The class diagram is closely aligned with our earlier assignment’s components such as the user stories, the use cases, and the state diagrams. An example would be that the student and educator use cases are represented by the respective subclasses of User, and then the user has actions like redeeming points or submitting disputes which are accurately modelled in class methods. But the system’s scalability and security requirements, which was noted in the initial specifications, are addressed through methods like encrypt_user_data() and load-handling relationships. There were some trade-offs I had to make which were necessary, an example would be while choosing the inheritance over composition for the user roles. The composition relationship does offer more flexibility than the inheritance relationship, the inheritance does provide a more clear and intuitive structure for our current system needs. I had to simplify certain relationships and add them into aggregations to reduce their complexity but improved the readability. While doing this assignment I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented design principles, learning more about encapsulation, responsibility-driven design, and the importance of clear, maintainable architecture. I also learned that having perfect foresight isn’t a requirement and that it’s better to design for your current known requirements to ensure the system is able to withstand future growth. This whole assignment helped build my confidence in domain modelling and showed me the value of a clean, and logical design while building a scalable, and user-aligned system.

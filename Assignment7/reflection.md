**Reflection** 

I was stuck between wanting to use the Team Planning template and the Automated Kanban template, then realised that the Automated Kanban template would be the better fit for the agile principles I was looking for in completing this assignment. I had trouble figuring out which columns to add to the current template due to the many options to add to choose from and trying to figure out which two would work well with the my project at hand.

Github's tempalates look visibly more appealing and seems so much easier to use than Jira.

**Template Analysis Table**

| Template | Columns and Workflows | Automation Features | Suitability for Agile Methodologies |
|----------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Basic Kanban | The columns are customizable with each being able to reflect the different team stages. The workflow is quite simple with a linear workflow. An example would look like "To Do" -> "In Progress" -> "Done". This template focuses on minimalism, and there are no automated rules for transitions. | There is barely any automation and users have to manually move tickets through each column. It's structure in it's simplest form and is best used for teams needing full control without much automation.| It is a core agile tool which supports iterative workflows, the daily standups, and has work in progress limits. It is both simple and flexible for Scrum or Kanban teams. |
| Automated Kanban | Is very similar to the Basic Kanban template, but has more rules allowing for automated transitions. An example would include something like "Code Review" -> "Testing on PR approval". The workflows have triggers that move tasks automatically. The rules are put in place to reduce the manual work. | It has the most robust automation out of all the templates. The rule-based triggers include auto-move tasks on completion, notifying the assignees, and the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. | It enhances the agile methodology with automation by reducing the manual overhead in sprint planning and the execution. |
| Bug Triage | It has columns that are tailored for bug lifecycles it includes specialised fields like severity or priority labels. An example of this template's worklfow would look like "New" -> "Triage" -> "Investigating" -> "Fixing" -> "Resolved". Bug Triage is mainly focused on bug fixing.| It has an auto-labeling feature, and escalates rules for high-priority bugs. It also focuses on streamlining bug prioritization and assignment of tasks.| It definitely fits the agile methodology and focuses on the continuous improvement. It is very much specialized for agile teams managing bug backlogs. 
| Team Planning | It combines task boards with timelines or Gantt charts for dependencies and milestones. It includes multi-dimensional workflows which may look similar to "Backlog" -> "Sprint Planning" -> "In Progress" -> "Review" -> "Done". It supports very complex project phases. | Team Planning automates timeline risks, the deadline reminders, and dependency alerts. The automation includes timeline management and proper resource allocation. | It supports a scaled agile methodology with timelines and cross-team dependencies. It's not a typical agile methodolgy structure but it is definitely adaptable.	It works well with a hybrid Agile-Waterfall project framework or a large-scale Agile coordination. |


**Justification** 

Automated Kanban integrates CI/CD pipelines which automatically moves the tasks to the different columns as soon as the code is merged. This reduces the manual work of doing it, giving the team working on this project more time to focus on their tasks then worrying about moving tickets on the board. It also allows everyone working on the project to see where everyone is with their tickets, so if they need to use code that another person is working on they will be able to see it in "real-time".

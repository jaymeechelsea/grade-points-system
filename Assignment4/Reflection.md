**Reflection**

Trying to design a system that meets the needs of all stakeholders including, the students, educators, and admins while maintaining strong security, performance, scalability, and usability is a difficult challenge. The goal is to create a system that meets the functional and non-functional requirements of all parties while maintaining a smooth user experience, secure operations, and scalability. The secret is prioritising the requirements based on core goals of the system, engage with stakeholders early in the design process, and iterate based on feedback. Constant testing, user input, and a deep understanding of each stakeholderâ€™s needs are essential for making informed trade-offs that result in a functional, secure, and user-friendly system. At the end of the day finding a good balance between the competing needs of all the stakeholders constant vigilance and a willingness to adapt as new requirements emerge and technology evolves.

**Storage Abstraction:**
The reason I chose the Factory Pattern over the Dependency Injection is because it is simple and centralized. This means that the Factory Pattern makes it easy to manage different types without complex Dependency Injection containers. It is also quite extensible when having to add new backends an example would be to add a database or file storage it just requires that I extend the factory. Another reason is that it is ideal for small to medium sized applications, where Dependency Injection would mean there will be more overhead for the current project size.
